# AirCnC Project Intro
This project was developed during the "Omnistack Week" which is a bootcamp promoted by "Rocketseat", a Brazilian coding institute.

The development was focused on learning one of the most popular JavaScripts stacks: 
  - Node.js for the backend
  - ReactJS for the Webapp Frontend 
  - React Native for the Mobile Frontend
  - Expo was also used for testing on iOS/Android devices.

The idea behind the application is to use a very similar business model that AirBnB uses and apply that to "Spots" where developers can go in and work from there for the day/week/month. Companies can make "spots" available for developers that are interested in working on their building, companies can also charge a daily rate for the spot or make it free of charge.
Developers then can use the application to search for spots on companies that use the technology they're interested in, the dev can then submit a reservation request for a date and if the company approves the request, the spot is then booked for that individual.
